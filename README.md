- The Swagger CLI to validate the OpenAPI specification.
- AWS SAM for the AWS resourses specification.
- AWS cloudformation to setup CI/CD in your AWS account.
- The Python unittest package for unit testing.
- Coverage, to ensure the Python code is 100% unit tested
- Prospector, a python tool that checks code quality.
- pylint_quotes, a pylint plugin to ensure a consistent Python quotation style.
- Bandit, a security testing Python tool
- Dredd, for contract testing against the OpenAPI definition, with hooks written in Python.
